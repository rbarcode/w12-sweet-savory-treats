#### By Richard Barbour II

#### C# ASP.NET Core MVC web application with many-to-many relationships using MySQL database and authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity.

## Technologies Used

* C#
* HTML
* .Net 6.0 SDK (incl. NuGet)
* ASP.NET Core MVC
* ASP.NET Core Identity
* MySQL 8.0.34
* Microsoft's Entity Framework Core
* Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql (3rd party provider for MySQL compatible databases)
* dotnet-ef

## Description

This web-based application presents users with the option to add flavors to treats and treats to flavors using a MySQL database and offers full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality for both flavors and treats. The user can navigate between the splash page and details pages for the individual flavor or treat. Authenticated users (i.e. logged in users) can add to the list of flavors and list of treats, as well as edit and delete flavors and treats.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Click on the green “<> Code” on the far right-hand side of the page's main column.
2. On the “Local” tab of the mini-window that opens underneath the “<>Code” button, copy the HTTPS link in the gray bar to your clipboard.
3. In GitBash (or a terminal shell of your choice), navigate to the directory where you wish to download the project and enter the following prompt (replacing the asterisked word with the appropriate link): `git clone *url-of-the-repository-copied-in-the-previous-step*`
4. Your chosen directory will now contain a folder titled "w12-sweet-savory-treats".
5. If you don't have the .Net Software Development Kit already installed on your computer, install it now. You may also wish to download the REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) tool called dotnet-script. You can install the relevant tools introduced in [this series of lessons on LearnHowToProgram.com](https://old.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c).
6. If you skipped the previous step and/or don't have MySQL and MySQL Workbench installed, follow the instructions in the LearnHowToProgram.com lesson ["Creating a Test Database: Exporting and Importing Databases with MySQL Workbench"](https://full-time.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/database-basics/creating-a-test-database-exporting-and-importing-databases-with-mysql-workbench).
7. Navigate into the production directory "Bakery" and create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
8. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values (i.e. "[YOUR_USERNAME]" and "[YOUR_PASSWORD]") with your own username and password for MySQL and choosing a name for your database (i.e. replacing the "[DATABASE_NAME]" with your chosen name). 

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[DATABASE_NAME];uid=[YOUR_USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR_PASSWORD];"
  }
}
```

9. To create your database, run the following command in your terminal: `dotnet ef database update`. You can check MySQL / MySQL Workbench to verify that the database has been created.
10. To build and run the web app on your local server, navigate to the Factory directory. In the command line of your terminal, enter the following command to compile and execute the application in a web browser with a watcher: `dotnet watch`. 
11. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
